# SuperRes
Welcome to SuperRes! 

To understand the capabilities and theory behind SuperRes, please read our paper:

[Super-resolution of multiphase materials by combining complementary 2D and 3D image data using generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11281)

## Overview

In very short, SuperRes requires (n >= m): 
- n-phase high-resolution 2D image.
- m-phase low-resolution 3D volume.

To produce an
- n-phase super-resolution 3D volume of the low-resolution 3D volume, with the fine characteristics and added features of the high-resolution 2D image.
